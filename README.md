# Beijing Project

This project was designed for me to learn how to link HTML files and work with videos and CSS. This Classic Actress Webpage was designed for me to experiment with colors, themes, image minipulations and manny other tools. This project includes some great HTML Code, CSS, JavaScript, Font-awesome and any other tools.
